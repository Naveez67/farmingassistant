        "Alfalfa, Medicago sativa, is an herbaceous perennial in the plant family Fabaceae (peas and beans) which is primarily grown as a forage crop which can be grazed by animals or harvested as hay to be used as an animal feed. Alfalfa has a deeply penetrating taproot and the stems of the plant branch from a woody base, growing upright and erect or along the ground. The leaves of the plant are made up of three individual leaflets (trifoliate) which are narrow and oval or oblong in shape with a smooth upper surface and slightly hairy lower surface. Alfalfa plants produce flowers on racemes (flower stalks) and each raceme possesses 10-35 densely packed purple flowers. Alfalfa produces spirally coiled seed pods each containing 2-6 seeds. Pods may have a smooth or hairy outer surface. Alfalfa plants can reach a height of 120 cm (47 in) and live for between 3 and 8 years. Alfalfa is also commonly referred to as Lucerne and is believed to have originated in Caucasus area, north-western Iran and north-eastern Turkey."

Barley is commonly used in breads, soups, stews, and health products, though it is primarily grown as animal fodder and as a source of malt for alcoholic beverages, especially beer. Barley has a nutlike flavor and is high in carbohydrates, with moderate quantities of protein, calcium, and phosphorus and small amounts of the B vitamins.

        "Amaranth is the name given to a group of approximately 70 species of annual or short-lived perennial plants in the genus Amaranthus including several species of aggressive edible weeds native to the US such as Amaranthus retroflexus (redroot pigweed). Amaranths are branching broad-leaved plants with egg-shaped or rhombic leaves which may be smooth or covered in tiny hairs. The leaves have prominent veins, can be green or red in color and have long petioles. The plants produce single flowers on terminal spikes which typically red to purple in color. Amaranths can reach up to 2.5 m (6.6 ft) in height and are usually grown as annuals, harvested after one growing season. Amaranth may also be referred to as Chinese spinach and their origin is unclear due to their worldwide distribution."

Its many varieties differ substantially in the shape and bitterness of the fruit. This herbaceous, tendril-bearing vine grows up to 5 m (16 ft) in length. It bears simple, alternate leaves 4-12 cm (1.6-4.7 in) across, with three to seven deeply separated lobes. When the fruit is fully ripe, it turns orange and mushy, and splits into segments which curl back dramatically to expose seeds covered in bright red pulp."

        "The bottle gourd is a commonly cultivated plant in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, now believed by some to have spread or originated from wild populations in southern Africa. The bottle gourd may have been carried from Africa to Asia, Europe and the Americas in the course of human migration or by seeds floating across the oceans inside the gourd. Nowadays, bottle gourds are grown by direct sowing of seeds or transplanting 15 to 20 day old seedlings. The plant prefers well-drained, moist, rich soil. It requires plenty of moisture in the growing season and a warm, sunny position, sheltered from the wind. It can be cultivated in small places such as in a pot and allowed to spread on a trellis or roof. Bottle gourds grow very rapidly and their stems can reach a length of 9 m in the summer, so they need a solid support along the stem if they are to climb a pole or trellis. If planted under a tall tree, the vine may grow up to the top of the tree. To obtain more fruit, farmers sometimes cut off the tip of the vine when it has grown to 6-8 feet in length. This forces the plant to produce side branches that soon bear flowers and yield more fruit."

In Pakistan, it occupies 9,044 ha area and its production is 88,148 tones. The fruit of brinjal is a fleshy berry and changed its color from shiny purple to black and white green yellow. The brinjal is a shrubby, herbaceous or semi-woody plant with a fibrous root system.

        "Cabbage (Brassica oleracea) is a leafy green, red (purple), or white (pale green) biennial plant grown as an annual vegetable crop for its dense-leaved heads. Cabbage heads generally range from 0.5 to 4 kilograms (1 to 9 lb), and can be green, purple or white. Smooth-leafed, firm-headed green cabbages are the most common. Smooth-leafed purple cabbages and crinkle-leafed savoy cabbages of both colors are more rare. It is a multi-layered vegetable. Cabbage was most likely domesticated somewhere in Europe before 1000 BC, although savoys were not developed until the 16th century AD. By the Middle Ages, cabbage had become a prominent part of European cuisine. Cabbage heads are generally picked during the first year of the plant's life cycle, but plants intended for seed are allowed to grow a second year, and must be kept separate from other cole crops to prevent cross-pollination. Cabbage is a good source of vitamin K, vitamin C and dietary fiber. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) reported that world production of cabbage and other brassicas for 2014 was 71.8 million metric tonnes, with China accounting for 47% of the world total."

Carrots are a domesticated form of the wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to Europe and southwestern Asia. The plant probably originated in Persia and was originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten part of the plant is the taproot, although the greens are sometimes eaten as well. The domestic carrot has been selectively bred for it’s greatly enlarged, more palatable, less woody textured taproot. Carrot has a good source of vitamin K and vitamin B6. It is a biennial plant in the umbel lifer family Apiaceae. At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot. Fast growing cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower maturing cultivars are harvested four months later (120 days). The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports that world production of carrots and turnips (these plants are combined by the FAO) for the calendar year 2013 was 37.2 million tones, almost half (45%) were grown in China. Carrots are widely used in many cuisines, especially in the preparation of salads and carrot salads are a tradition in many regional cuisines."

The inflorescences bear pale yellow with purple flowers and arise directly from the rhizome on separate shoots. Ginger originated in the tropical rainforests from the Indian subcontinent to Southern Asia where ginger plants show considerable genetic variation. As one of the first spices exported from the Orient, ginger arrived in Europe during the spice trade, and was used by ancient Greeks and Romans. The distantly related dicots in the genus Asarum are commonly called wild ginger because of their similar taste."

Pea pods are botanically fruit, since they contain seeds and developed from the ovary of a (pea) flower. Pea is an annual plant, with a life cycle of one year. It is a cool-season crop grown in many parts of the world; planting can take place from winter to early summer depending on location. The average pea weighs between 0.1 and 0.36 grams. The immature peas (and in snow peas the tender pod as well) are used as a vegetable, fresh, frozen or canned; varieties of the species typically called field peas are grown to produce dry peas like the split pea shelled from the matured pod. The wild pea is restricted to the Mediterranean basin and the Near East. The earliest archaeological finds of peas date from the late neolithic era of current Greece, Syria, Turkey and Jordan. In Egypt, early finds date from ca. 4800-4400 BC in the Nile delta area, and from ca. 3800-3600 BC in Upper Egypt. The pea was also present in Georgia in the 5th millennium BC. Farther east, the finds are younger. Peas were present in Afghanistan ca. 2000 BC, in Harappa, Pakistan, and in northwest India in 2250-1750 BC."
